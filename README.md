# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Sergio

I'm a Computer Science student focused on full-stack development, with a strong background in databases, software engineering, and modern web technologies.
I enjoy solving problems, breaking code (and then fixing it), and learning how to build scalable applications.  

Fun fact: My `debugging skills > my sleeping schedule`.
